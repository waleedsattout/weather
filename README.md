# Weather app

## Why?

I just wanna practice some angular and other stuff, so I needed to put it in a project.

## What did i use?

- This project was done using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.1.
- Colors from [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities)
- Some nice animated icons from [Meteocons](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons)
- The most important thing is [Weather api](https://open-meteo.com/)

# What to do?

- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
